                <p>An investigation into Australia’s catastrophic wildfire season has recommended greater efforts to forecast the impacts of climate change on specific parts of the country, warning fire behavior was becoming more extreme. The fires killed
                    at least 33 people including 10 firefighters, destroyed more than 3,000 hones, razed 19 million hectares (47 million acres) and displaced thousands of residents. </p>

                    <h1>Greenland's Retreating Glaciers Could Impact Local Ecology</h1>
                    <p>A new study of Greenland's shrinking ice sheet reveals that many of the island's glaciers are not only retreating, but are also undergoing other physical changes. Some of those changes are causing the rerouting of freshwater rivers
                        beneath the glaciers, where it meets the bedrock. These rivers carry nutrients into the ocean, so this reconfiguring has the potential to impact the local ecology as well as the human communities that depend on it.</p>

                            The study estimates that about 15 per cent of deaths worldwide from Covid-19 could be attributed to long-term exposure to air pollution. </p>

                            <p>Scientists have sounded the alarm over Arctic sea ice levels after researchers reported much of the region had not yet started to refreeze by late October, the latest date since records began. Conservationists have warned that
                                a lack of sea ice is not just a gloomy portent of climate change but could affect sea life as drifting ice carries with it nutrients for Arctic plankton.</p>
